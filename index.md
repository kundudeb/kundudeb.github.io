## About Me

In June 2020, I earned my Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Toronto. My supervisor was [Prof. Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/) and my co-advisor was [Prof R. Sujatha](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~sujatha/). In Fall 2020, I was at CRM Montreal attending the [Thematic Program on Cohomology in Arithmetic](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2020/Nombres2020/index_e.php). Between January 2021 and December 2022, I was a [PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2020) at [UBC, Vancouver](https://www.math.ubc.ca/Research/NumberTheory/index.shtml?overview). I was affiliated with the [Fields Institute](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/) between January and August 2023. Since Fall 2023, I am a tenure track assistant professor at [UTRGV](https://www.utrgv.edu/math/). 

My curriculum vitae can be found here: [CV](cv.pdf).

## Research

My research interests include Diophantine equations, Iwasawa theory, and Beyond Endoscopy. 

For my PhD thesis, I studied growth patterns of fine Selmer groups in infinite towers of number fields.
I have also worked on questions in non-commutative Iwasawa theory.

I have started studying questions which lie at the intersection of Iwasawa theory and arithmetic statistics. 
In particular, a long-term goal is to understand the average behaviour of the Iwasawa invariants for class groups and Selmer groups of elliptic curves.

More recently, I have started thinking about questions related to Diophantine stability and Hilbert's 10th Problem.

I am interested in Langlands' Functoriality Conjecture and related problems in the Langlands program 
like the Langlands' Beyond Endoscopy idea.

## Teaching

In Spring 2024, I am teaching MATH 3363 (Modern Algebra I).

In Fall 2023, I taught MATH 2413 (Calculus I).

I have taught Calculus (single and multi-variable) and first year Linear Algebra at the University of Toronto and UBC (Vancouver). 
While I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto, I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses. 

To know about my teaching philosophy you can read my [teaching statement](teaching%20statement.pdf).  

## Service

I was a member of the UBC [Math Department's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee](https://www.math.ubc.ca/about-our-department/equity-diversity-and-inclusion) for the academic year 2021-22.

I gave an invited talk  on [Möbius Functions](Mobius%20Functions.pdf) at the [Summer Math Academy](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/ma) for high school students. I would also volunteer to run the 
[monthly STEM Workshop](https://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/girlsinstem). 

I believe in the [axioms laid out by Federico Ardila-Mantilla](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf).<br/>
1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic,
demographic, and economic boundaries. <br/>

2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. <br/>

3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.<br/>

4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. <br/>

5. (My addition) Mathematics will be better with you in it. 

## Organization

While I was a graduate student, I organized the weekly [GANITA seminars](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/20-21/ganita-seminar). I still attend these seminars whenever I can. If you are a number theorist wandering in the Toronto region, eager to interact with others of your kind, you are welcome to participate. Or better yet, give a talk!

I co-organized a [mini-course on Iwasawa Theory](https://winter19.cms.math.ca/index.php/mini-courses/) at the 2019 CMS Winter Meeting. Here is a [PDF](CMS%20Winter%20meet.pdf).

You can click [here](https://kundudeb.github.io/p-adic-seminar.html) to access the homepage of the seminar series meant to prepare participants for the workshop on Higher Coleman Theory and its Applications which was held at the CRM (December 7-11, 2020).

Between September 2021 and December 2022, I was an organizer of the weekly [UBC Number Theory Seminar](https://www.math.ubc.ca/news-events/seminars-and-colloquia).

I was a co-organizer for the [Beyond Endoscopy Mini Conference](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/endoscopy) in April 2023. 

I was a project leader at the [Rethinking Number Theory Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rethinkingnumbertheory/home) in June 2023.

I am currently organizing the [Algebra/Number Theory Seminar](https://faculty.utrgv.edu/luigi.ferraro/ANT/Spring24.html) at UTRGV with my colleague Luigi Ferraro.

I will be organizing a special session with my colleague Brandt Kronholm at the AMS Fall Sectional Meeting in San Antonio (Sep 15-16, 2024).
