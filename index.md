## About Me

In June 2020, I earned my Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Toronto. My supervisor was [Prof. Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/) and my co-advisor was [Prof R. Sujatha](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~sujatha/). In Fall 2020, I was at CRM Montreal attending the [Thematic Program on Cohomology in Arithmetic](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2020/Nombres2020/index_e.php). Starting January 2021, I am a [PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral/postdoctoral-fellows#pdf-2020) at [UBC, Vancouver](https://www.math.ubc.ca/Research/NumberTheory/index.shtml?overview).

My curriculum vitae can be found here: [CV](cv.pdf).

## Research

My research interests include Diophantine equations, Iwasawa theory, and Beyond Endoscopy. 

For my PhD thesis, my focus is to understand growth patterns of fine Selmer groups in infinite towers of number fields.
In the process, I have been able to provide non-trivial evidence for Coates-Sujatha Conjecture A. I have worked on questions in non-commutative Iwasawa theory and have provided evidence for Coates-Sujatha pseudo-nullity conjecture.

Recently, I have started studying questions which lie at the intersection of Iwasawa theory and arithmetic statistics. 
In particular, I would like to understand the average behaviour of the Iwasawa invariants for class groups and Selmer groups of elliptic curves.

I am also interested in Langlands' Functoriality Conjecture and related problems in the Langlands program 
like the Langlands' Beyond Endoscopy idea.

To know more about my research you can look at my [research statement](Research%20Statement%20Application.pdf). If you prefer a shorter read, without much technical details you can look at this [research statement](non%20technical%20research%20proposal.pdf).

## Teaching

I have taught Calculus (single and multi-variable) and first year Linear Algebra at the University of Toronto and UBC (Vancouver). 
Over the years, I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses. 

To know about my teaching philosophy you can read my [teaching statement](teaching%20statement.pdf).  

## Outreach

I was a mentor for the [University of Toronto High School Mentorship Program](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/mentorship).<br/>
Winter 2018: Anna Krokhine (graph theory and combinatorics)<br/>
Winter 2019: Maya Bozzo-Ray (Benford's Law)<br/>
Winter 2020: Jennifer Wang (Group Theory and Elementary Number Theory)

I gave an invited talk  on [Möbius Functions](Mobius%20Functions.pdf) at the [Summer Math Academy](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/ma) for high school students. I would also volunteer to run the 
[monthly STEM Workshop](https://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/girlsinstem). 

I believe in the [axioms laid out by Federico Ardila-Mantilla](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf).<br/>
1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic,
demographic, and economic boundaries. <br/>

2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. <br/>

3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.<br/>

4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

## Organization

While I was a graduate student, I organized the weekly [GANITA seminars](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/20-21/ganita-seminar). Unfortunately, I can no longer attend these seminars regularly. If you are a number theorist ~~wandering in the Toronto region~~, eager to interact with others of your kind online, you are welcome to participate. Or better yet, give a talk!

I co-organized a [mini-course on Iwasawa Theory](https://winter19.cms.math.ca/index.php/mini-courses/) at the 2019 CMS Winter Meeting. Here is a [PDF](CMS%20Winter%20meet.pdf).

You can click [here](https://kundudeb.github.io/p-adic-seminar.html) to access the homepage of the seminar series meant to prepare participants for the workshop on Higher Coleman Theory and its Applications which was held at the CRM (December 7-11, 2020).
