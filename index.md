## About Me

In June 2020, I earned my Ph.D in mathematics at the University of Toronto. My supervisor was [Prof. Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/) and my co-advisor was [Prof R. Sujatha](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~sujatha/). In Fall 2020, I will be at CRM Montreal attending the [Thematic Program on Cohomology in Arithmetic](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2020/Nombres2020/index_e.php). Starting January 2021, I will be a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow at UBC, Vancouver.

I organize the weekly [GANITA seminars](https://seminars.math.toronto.edu/seminars/list/events.py/process?start). If you are a number theorist wandering in the Toronto region, come listen to us. Or better yet, give a talk!

My curriculum vitae can be found here: [CV](cv.pdf).

## Research

My research interests include Diophantine equations, Iwasawa theory, and Beyond Endoscopy. 

For my PhD thesis, my focus is to understand growth patterns of fine Selmer groups in infinite towers of number fields.
In the process, I have been able to provide non-trivial evidence for Coates-Sujatha Conjecture A. I have worked on questions in non-commutative Iwasawa theory and have provided evidence for Coates-Sujatha pseudo-nullity conjecture.

I am also interested in Langlands' Functoriality Conjecture and related problems in the Langlands program 
like the Langlands' Beyond Endoscopy idea.

## Teaching

At the University of Toronto, I have taught first year Calculus and first year Linear Algebra. 
Over the years, I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses. 

To know about my teaching philosophy you can read my [teaching statement](teaching%20statement.pdf).  

## Outreach

I am a mentor for the [University of Toronto High School Mentorship Program](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/mentorship).<br/>
Winter 2018: Anna Krokhine (graph theory and combinatorics)<br/>
Winter 2019: Maya Bozzo-Ray (Benford's Law)<br/>
Winter 2020: Jennifer Wang (Group Theory and Elementary Number Theory)

I gave an invited talk  on [Möbius Functions](Mobius%20Functions.pdf) at the [Summer Math Academy](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/ma) for High School students. I also volunteer to run the 
[monthly STEM Workshop](https://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/girlsinstem). 

I believe in the [axioms laid out by Federico Ardila-Mantilla](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf).<br/>
1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic,
demographic, and economic boundaries. <br/>

2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. <br/>

3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.<br/>

4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

## Organization

I co-organized a [mini-course on Iwasawa Theory](https://winter19.cms.math.ca/index.php/mini-courses/) at the 2019 CMS Winter Meeting. Here is a [PDF](CMS%20Winter%20meet.pdf).
