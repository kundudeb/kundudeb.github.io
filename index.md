## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.toronto.edu/), University of Toronto working with [Prof. Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/). My co-advisor is [Prof R. Sujatha](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~sujatha/).

I organize the weekly [GANITA seminars](https://seminars.math.toronto.edu/seminars/list/events.py/process). If you are a number theorist wandering in the Toronto region, come listen to us. Or better yet, give a talk!

My curriculum vitae can be found here: [CV](cv_webpage.pdf).

## Research

My research interests include Diophantine equations, Iwasawa theory, and Beyond Endoscopy. 

For my PhD thesis, my focus is to understand growth patterns of fine Selmer groups in infinite towers of number fields.
In the process, I have been able to provide non-trivial evidence for Coates-Sujatha Conjecture A. I have also worked on non-commutative Iwasawa theory questions, and provided evidence for Coates-Sujatha pseudo-nullity conjecture.

I am also interested in Langlands' Functoriality Conjecture and related problems in the Langlands program 
like the Langlands' Beyond Endoscopy idea.
