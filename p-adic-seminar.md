# Preparatory Seminar

Welcome! This site is the homepage of the seminar series meant to prepare participants for the workshop on [Higher Coleman Theory and its Applications](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2020/Coleman20/index_e.php) to be held at the CRM (December 7-11, 2020).

Here is some material to prepare for the upcoming workshop (suggestions by Prof. Adrian Iovita):

## Background.

1) J.-P. Serre: A course in Arithmetic. 

This is a good introduction to modular forms for people who didn't see them.

2) Swinnerton-Dyer: $$\ell$$-Adic representations and congruences for coefficients of modular forms.

This paper has a chapter in which he defines modular forms modulo $$p$$.

3) J.-P. Serre: Formes modulaires et fonctions zeta $$p$$-adiques (French).

In this article, Serre defines $$p$$-adic modular forms as $$q$$-expansions.

4) N. Katz: $$p$$-Adic properties of modular forms and modular schemes.

This is an important, but long paper: he defines overconvergent modular forms, he constructs canonical subgroups of elliptic curves, finally he defines geometrically the $$p$$-adic modular forms of Serre.

Articles 2, 3, 4 can be found [here](1973_Book_ModularFunctionsOfOneVariableI.pdf)

5) R. Coleman: [$$p$$-Adic Banach spaces and families of modular forms.](1997_Coleman.pdf) 

This is an important paper but difficult to read. He defines the Coleman $$p$$-adic families of elliptic modular forms and $$q$$-expansions.

6) A. Ash, G. Stevens: [$$p$$-Adic Deformation of Arithmetic Cohomology.](http://math.bu.edu/people/ghs/preprints/Ash-Stevens-02-08.pdf)

This paper has a chapter in which slope decomposition of a compact operator on a Banach module is explained very well.

7) V. Pilloni: [Formes modulaires surconvergentes](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/vincent.pilloni/formes_surc.pdf) (French).

Here the Coleman families of elliptic modular forms are defined geometrically by first defining modular sheaves of arbitrary $$p$$-adic weight.

8) F. Andreatta, A. Iovita, V. Pilloni: [$$p$$-Adic families of Siegel modular cuspforms.](p%20adic%20families%20of%20Siegel%20modular%20cuspforms.pdf)

Here the $$p$$-adic families of Siegel modular cuspforms are defined geometrically.

9) F. Andreatta, A. Iovita, V. Pilloni: [$$p$$-Adic variation of automorphic sheaves.](ICM.pdf)

In this paper the general machine of vector bundles with marked sections is constructed. This machine produces $$p$$-adic families of everything: modular sheaves, modular symbols, de Rham classes.

## Papers relevant for the workshop.

1) V. Pilloni: [Higher coherent cohomology and $$p$$-adic modular forms of singular weight.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01393374/document)

2) G. Boxer, V. Pilloni: [Higher Hida and Coleman theory for modular curves.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06845.pdf) 

3) D. Loeffler, V. Pilloni, C. Skinner, S. Zerbes: [Higher Hida theory and $$p$$-adic $$L$$-functions for $$\rm {GSp}_4$$.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08779.pdf)

4) G. Boxer, V. Pilloni: [Higher Coleman Theory](HigherColeman.pdf)
